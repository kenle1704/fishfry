        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

        # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
        # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
        # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
        # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
        # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>
11. modify ALLOWED_HOSTS to only allow certain url to access your api 
12. modify CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL to FALSE and add CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST

FUNTION
THis will provide api for frontend page, thus it have quite similar structure as frontend , more detail api url will be in urls.py 
1. BOATSERVICE
_ this will provide all boatservice + Swimlane data, swimlane data will make construct the board easier and in order we want 
_ boatservice detail api will provide individual card information along with swimlane, boat and guide 
2. BOAT/GUIDE/SWIMLANE
_simple function get all data from each table and update/detele/add single item 
3. ADMIN
_this will allow you to create super user for django api to control back end user and group
4. django provide very nice view of api thus you will find it is very easy to go through each api url 
TODO
Permission authentication and database update to archive frontend todo list
